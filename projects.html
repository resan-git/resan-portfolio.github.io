  <h2>
    Pressure-Monitored Non-Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG)
  </h2>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Biomedical Device Design | Level 3 Term 1
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong>
    Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) accounts for a significant portion of maternal
    mortality in low-resource settings. Conventional non-pneumatic anti-shock
    garments are effective for temporary stabilization but lack mechanisms
    for monitoring and controlling applied pressure, raising concerns about
    safety and effectiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong>
    We designed an enhanced NASG incorporating real-time pressure monitoring
    and feedback. Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) were embedded into the garment
    and interfaced with an Arduino Nano to continuously measure applied pressure.
    A customizable lacing mechanism enabled controlled, segment-wise pressure
    application using durable Neoprene fabric and stainless steel buckles.
  </p>

  <p>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time pressure acquisition using FSR sensors</li>
    <li>Automated buzzer-based alarm for unsafe pressure levels</li>
    <li>Neoprene-based garment design to prevent permanent deformation</li>
    <li>Improved mechanical reliability using stainless steel buckles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Calibration & Validation:</strong>
    The system was calibrated using a standard blood pressure cuff and human
    subjects. ADC thresholds corresponding to 30–50 mmHg were established.
    Performance was validated using a simulated limb model and human testing,
    confirming stable pressure maintenance without discomfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong>
    The prototype successfully maintained an optimized pressure range
    (30–50 mmHg), demonstrated effective fluid redistribution toward the core,
    and showed no significant material degradation over time.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Low-Cost Ankle Joint Exoskeleton for Foot-Drop Assistance
  </h2>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Assistive Biomechanical System | Level 3 Term 2
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong>
    Foot drop is a gait disorder characterized by impaired dorsiflexion,
    significantly increasing fall risk and limiting mobility. Existing
    assistive exoskeleton solutions are often expensive and inaccessible,
    particularly in low-resource settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong>
    We designed a low-cost, sensor-driven ankle exoskeleton capable of detecting
    gait phases and providing real-time mechanical assistance. The system uses
    force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) to detect foot-ground interaction and
    triggers controlled ankle motion through a high-torque servo-driven
    actuation mechanism.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Key Engineering Innovations:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cost-efficient assistive design (~USD 180 total system cost)</li>
    <li>Chain-and-sprocket transmission driven by a 35 kg digital servo motor</li>
    <li>Hybrid structural design using aluminum, stainless steel, and 3D-printed PLA</li>
    <li>Real-time gait phase detection using FSR-based feedback</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>System Architecture:</strong>
    An Arduino Uno microcontroller processes pressure signals from FSR sensors
    embedded in the footplate. Based on calibrated thresholds, the controller
    activates the servo motor during appropriate gait phases to assist ankle
    dorsiflexion and stabilize foot positioning.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Validation & Testing:</strong>
    Calibration experiments were conducted on multiple healthy subjects to tune
    sensor thresholds and verify timing accuracy. Iterative mechanical
    refinements, including CNC-cut aluminum connectors and joint lubrication,
    improved durability and reduced friction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong>
    The final prototype demonstrated effective real-time assistance, portable
    battery-powered operation, and adjustable support levels. The system
    highlights the feasibility of building functional assistive exoskeletons
    using low-cost components.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong>
    Arduino Uno, Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), digital servo motor (35 kg),
    aluminum alloy frame, stainless steel sprockets, 3D-printed PLA components,
    Li-ion battery system.

  </h2>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Biomedical Signal Processing & PCB Design | Level 3 Term 1
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong>
    Biopotential signals such as ECG and EMG have very low amplitudes and are
    highly susceptible to motion artifacts and electromagnetic interference,
    making accurate acquisition and interpretation challenging in portable
    systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong>
    We designed two optimized signal acquisition chains for ECG and EMG,
    integrating precision amplification, multi-stage filtering, embedded
    processing, and wireless data transmission to a mobile application for
    real-time monitoring.

    <h2>
      Interactive Thermal Image Analysis Tool Using Color-to-Temperature Mapping
    </h2>
  
    <p class="subtitle">
      Medical Imaging & GUI Development | Imaging Course (Level 4 Term 1)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong>
      Infrared (IR) thermal cameras visualize temperature distributions using
      color-coded heatmaps. However, interpreting exact temperature values from
      these images often requires manual reference to color bars, which is
      inefficient and prone to error during analysis.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Approach:</strong>
      We developed an interactive MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI)
      that allows users to click on any pixel within a thermal image and instantly
      retrieve the corresponding temperature value by mapping RGB intensities to
      a predefined thermal colormap.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Methodology:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extracted the reference thermal colormap provided by the IR camera system</li>
      <li>Sliced the colormap into discrete RGB values associated with known temperatures</li>
      <li>Stored RGB–temperature pairs in an indexed array</li>
      <li>Computed Euclidean distance between clicked pixel RGB values and reference colormap</li>
      <li>Assigned the temperature corresponding to the minimum distance match</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>GUI Functionality:</strong>
      The interface enables users to load thermal images, interactively select
      arbitrary locations using mouse clicks, and display the estimated
      temperature value at the selected region in real time.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong>
      The system successfully translated color-coded thermal information into
      quantitative temperature readings, enabling intuitive and efficient thermal
      analysis without requiring manual interpretation of color bars.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong>
      MATLAB, image processing toolbox, GUI development, RGB color space analysis,
      infrared thermal imaging data.

      <strong>Extensions & Future Scope:</strong>
      Adding region-based averaging, automated hotspot detection, improved
      interpolation across color bands, and real-time video stream processing
      from IR cameras.
