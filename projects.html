    Assistive Biomechanical System | Level 3 Term 2
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong>
    Foot drop is a gait disorder characterized by impaired dorsiflexion,
    significantly increasing fall risk and limiting mobility. Existing
    assistive exoskeleton solutions are often expensive and inaccessible,
    particularly in low-resource settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong>
    We designed a low-cost, sensor-driven ankle exoskeleton capable of detecting
    gait phases and providing real-time mechanical assistance. The system uses
    force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) to detect foot-ground interaction and
    triggers controlled ankle motion through a high-torque servo-driven
    actuation mechanism.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Key Engineering Innovations:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cost-efficient assistive design (~USD 180 total system cost)</li>
    <li>Chain-and-sprocket transmission driven by a 35 kg digital servo motor</li>
    <li>Hybrid structural design using aluminum, stainless steel, and 3D-printed PLA</li>
    <li>Real-time gait phase detection using FSR-based feedback</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>System Architecture:</strong>
    An Arduino Uno microcontroller processes pressure signals from FSR sensors
    embedded in the footplate. Based on calibrated thresholds, the controller
    activates the servo motor during appropriate gait phases to assist ankle
    dorsiflexion and stabilize foot positioning.

  </figure>


  <p>
    <strong>Validation & Testing:</strong>
    Calibration experiments were conducted on multiple healthy subjects to tune
    sensor thresholds and verify timing accuracy. Iterative mechanical
    refinements, including CNC-cut aluminum connectors and joint lubrication,
    improved durability and reduced friction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong>
    The final prototype demonstrated effective real-time assistance, portable
    battery-powered operation, and adjustable support levels. The system
    highlights the feasibility of building functional assistive exoskeletons
    using low-cost components.

    Biomedical Device Design | Level 3 Term 1
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong>
    Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) accounts for a significant portion of maternal
    mortality in low-resource settings. Conventional non-pneumatic anti-shock

    <li>Neoprene-based garment design to prevent permanent deformation</li>
    <li>Improved mechanical reliability using stainless steel buckles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Calibration & Validation:</strong>
    The system was calibrated using a standard blood pressure cuff and human
    subjects. ADC thresholds corresponding to 30–50 mmHg were established.
    Performance was validated using a simulated limb model and human testing,
    confirming stable pressure maintenance without discomfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong>
    The prototype successfully maintained an optimized pressure range
    (30–50 mmHg), demonstrated effective fluid redistribution toward the core,
    and showed no significant material degradation over time.

    <h2>
      Interactive Thermal Image Analysis Tool Using Color-to-Temperature Mapping
    </h2>
  
    <p class="subtitle">
      Medical Imaging & GUI Development | Imaging Course (Level 4 Term 1)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong>
      Infrared (IR) thermal cameras visualize temperature distributions using
      color-coded heatmaps. However, interpreting exact temperature values from
      these images often requires manual reference to color bars, which is
      inefficient and prone to error during analysis.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Approach:</strong>
      We developed an interactive MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI)
      that allows users to click on any pixel within a thermal image and instantly
      retrieve the corresponding temperature value by mapping RGB intensities to
      a predefined thermal colormap.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Methodology:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extracted the reference thermal colormap provided by the IR camera system</li>
      <li>Sliced the colormap into discrete RGB values associated with known temperatures</li>
      <li>Stored RGB–temperature pairs in an indexed array</li>
      <li>Computed Euclidean distance between clicked pixel RGB values and reference colormap</li>
      <li>Assigned the temperature corresponding to the minimum distance match</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>GUI Functionality:</strong>
      The interface enables users to load thermal images, interactively select
      arbitrary locations using mouse clicks, and display the estimated
      temperature value at the selected region in real time.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong>
      The system successfully translated color-coded thermal information into
      quantitative temperature readings, enabling intuitive and efficient thermal
      analysis without requiring manual interpretation of color bars.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong>
      MATLAB, image processing toolbox, GUI development, RGB color space analysis,
      infrared thermal imaging data.

      Parallel Cascade Modeling of Ankle Joint Stiffness
    </h2>
  
    <p class="subtitle">
      Biomechanical System Identification & Control | Control Systems Course (Level 3 Term 2)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong>
      Ankle joint stiffness represents the dynamic relationship between joint
      angular displacement and the resulting torque. Accurate identification of
      this relationship is essential for understanding human motor control and
      designing rehabilitation devices that interact safely with the human body.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Objective:</strong>
      To develop a Parallel Cascade Model capable of separating and identifying
      the two fundamental contributors to ankle joint stiffness: intrinsic
      mechanical stiffness and reflex-mediated neural stiffness.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Model Architecture:</strong>
      The total ankle torque was modeled as the sum of two parallel pathways:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Intrinsic Stiffness Path:</strong>
        Representing passive joint mechanics, modeled as a second-order linear
        system defined by inertia (I), viscosity (B), and elasticity (K).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reflex Stiffness Path:</strong>
        Representing neuromuscular feedback, modeled using a
        Linear–Nonlinear–Linear (LNL) structure incorporating physiological delay,
        half-wave rectification, and a second-order linear dynamic system.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Simulation & Methodology:</strong>
      A comprehensive block-diagram model was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink.
      Realistic physiological parameters were selected based on literature, and
      the system was excited using both simulated and experimentally derived
      joint position inputs.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Key Results:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Successful decomposition of total torque into intrinsic and reflex components</li>
      <li>High correlation between simulated torque and reference experimental data</li>
      <li>Clear open-loop insights into the independent effects of intrinsic parameters and reflex gain</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong>
      The parallel cascade model accurately captured the time-varying behavior of
      ankle joint mechanics, demonstrating its effectiveness in representing both
      mechanical and neural contributions to joint stiffness.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong>
      MATLAB, Simulink, system identification, control theory, biomechanical
      modeling.

      <strong>Significance:</strong>
      This modeling framework is directly applicable to rehabilitation robotics,
      active prosthetics, and wearable exoskeletons, where safe and adaptive
      human–machine interaction requires accurate representation of joint
      dynamics.

      Tumor Growth Dynamics Modeling Using Fractional Calculus
    </h2>
  
    <p class="subtitle">
      Mathematical Modeling & Medical Image Analysis | Imaging Course (Level 4 Term 1)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Problem:</strong>
      In oncology, incomplete tumor resection and microscopic residual cells often
      lead to tumor recurrence and poor patient prognosis. Predicting tumor
      regrowth dynamics remains a critical challenge in treatment planning.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Objective:</strong>
      To develop a mathematically grounded prediction framework for tumor growth
      dynamics using fractional calculus, enabling more interpretable and reliable
      modeling compared to black-box machine learning approaches.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Methodology:</strong>
      The project implemented an image-driven modeling pipeline to simulate tumor
      progression on two-dimensional raster masks:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Preprocessing of medical images to isolate anatomical regions</li>
      <li>Segmentation of skull, brain region, and tumor mask</li>

      <li>Visualization of proliferating and non-dividing tumor regions</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Modeling Framework:</strong>
      Fractional-order differential equations were employed to capture the
      memory-dependent and non-local growth behavior of tumor cells, providing a
      more realistic representation than conventional integer-order models.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Quantitative Results:</strong>
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Average accuracy: 99.8%</li>
      <li>Dice coefficient: 0.934</li>
      <li>Specificity: 0.999</li>
      <li>Average processing time: 0.873 seconds</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong>
      The model successfully simulated malignant tumor growth over a 100-day
      period, tracking proliferating area <em>u(t)</em>, non-dividing cell area
      <em>v(t)</em>, and growth rate <em>w(t)</em>, demonstrating both high accuracy
      and computational efficiency.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong>
      MATLAB, image processing, fractional calculus, numerical simulation,
      mathematical modeling.
