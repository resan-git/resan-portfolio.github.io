  <h2>
    Pressure-Monitored Non-Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG)
  </h2>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Biomedical Device Design | Level 3 Term 1
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Problem:</strong>
    Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) accounts for a significant portion of maternal
    mortality in low-resource settings. Conventional non-pneumatic anti-shock
    garments are effective for temporary stabilization but lack mechanisms
    for monitoring and controlling applied pressure, raising concerns about
    safety and effectiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong>
    We designed an enhanced NASG incorporating real-time pressure monitoring
    and feedback. Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) were embedded into the garment
    and interfaced with an Arduino Nano to continuously measure applied pressure.
    A customizable lacing mechanism enabled controlled, segment-wise pressure
    application using durable Neoprene fabric and stainless steel buckles.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Key Engineering Innovations:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time pressure acquisition using FSR sensors</li>
    <li>Automated buzzer-based alarm for unsafe pressure levels</li>
    <li>Neoprene-based garment design to prevent permanent deformation</li>
    <li>Improved mechanical reliability using stainless steel buckles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Calibration & Validation:</strong>
    The system was calibrated using a standard blood pressure cuff and human
    subjects. ADC thresholds corresponding to 30–50 mmHg were established.
    Performance was validated using a simulated limb model and human testing,
    confirming stable pressure maintenance without discomfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong>
    The prototype successfully maintained an optimized pressure range
    (30–50 mmHg), demonstrated effective fluid redistribution toward the core,
    and showed no significant material degradation over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong>
    Arduino Nano, Force Sensitive Resistors (FSR), Neoprene fabric,
    stainless steel mechanical components, basic signal conditioning circuits.

    <strong>Future Scope:</strong>
    Incorporating multiple sensors for spatial averaging, rechargeable power
    systems, and fully automated pressure regulation using closed-loop control.
