        Mitigating Demographic Bias in Skin Lesion Classification Using GANs
      </p>

      <p>
        Public dermatology datasets are heavily skewed toward lighter skin tones,
        leading to biased diagnostic performance for darker skin populations.
        My undergraduate thesis investigates dataset-level bias mitigation
        through synthetic data generation rather than solely model-level fixes.

      <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed Pix2Pix and CycleGAN-based pipelines for skin lesion image synthesis</li>
        <li>Controlled image generation across six Fitzpatrick skin tone categories</li>
        <li>Designed semantic maps encoding skin tone via background color</li>
        <li>Integrated a skin tone classifier as an auxiliary GAN loss</li>
        <li>Built preprocessing pipelines for background and hair removal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Methodology Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The study combines paired (Pix2Pix) and unpaired (CycleGAN) image-to-image
        translation frameworks with a classifier-guided feedback mechanism.
        Generated images are evaluated using downstream skin disease
        classification performance across different skin tones.
      </p>


        <h3>Key Observations</h3>
      <p>
        While the proposed models successfully control global skin tone appearance,
        preserving fine-grained lesion characteristics remains challenging.
        Clinical feedback highlighted the risk of diagnostic feature distortion,
        emphasizing the limitations of current GAN-based augmentation.
