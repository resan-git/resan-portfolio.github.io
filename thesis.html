  <h2>
    Skin Tone–Aware Generation of Dermatological Images Using GAN-Based Models
  </h2>

  <p class="intro">
    This thesis investigates the problem of racial and skin-tone bias in
    dermatological image datasets and proposes a generative deep learning
    framework to synthesize skin lesion images across diverse Fitzpatrick skin
    tones while preserving lesion-specific characteristics.
  </p>

  <section class="thesis-section">
    <h3>Research Motivation</h3>

    <p>
      Most publicly available dermatology datasets are heavily biased toward
      lighter skin tones, resulting in reduced diagnostic performance for darker
      skin populations. This imbalance limits the fairness and generalizability
      of AI-based diagnostic systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this thesis is to address this imbalance by generating
      skin-tone–diverse lesion images that preserve medically relevant lesion
      features while varying only the surrounding skin tone.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Used Pix2Pix and CycleGAN architectures for image-to-image translation</li>
      <li>Generated semantic maps encoding lesion region and target skin tone</li>
      <li>Applied Fitzpatrick skin tone labeling (1–6) for controlled generation</li>
      <li>Integrated a pretrained skin tone classifier to enforce tone consistency</li>
      <li>Performed background removal and hair artifact reduction for robustness</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Contributions</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Proposed a controllable image generation framework for six Fitzpatrick skin tones</li>
      <li>Preserved lesion morphology while varying skin tone appearance</li>
      <li>Introduced classifier-guided loss for tone-aware generation</li>
      <li>Analyzed the impact of synthetic data on downstream disease classification</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results & Observations</h3>

    <p>
      The proposed model successfully generated skin lesion images across
      different skin tones. However, expert clinical feedback indicated that
      while skin tone variation was achieved, certain disease-specific visual
      features were not always preserved with sufficient fidelity.
    </p>

    <p>
      This highlights the limitations of current GAN-based approaches in
      medical image synthesis and underscores the importance of
      clinician-in-the-loop evaluation.

    <h3>Thesis Status</h3>

    <p>
      This work was completed as part of the undergraduate thesis requirement.
      A formal thesis defense presentation was conducted, and the work is
      currently being refined for potential extension in future graduate
      research.
